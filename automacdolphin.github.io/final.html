    <div class="lado"><h2>Daigo</h2> 
  <p id="texto">Daigo began going to an arcade game center and playing fighting games as an elementary school student around 10 years of age.Street Fighter II and Fatal Fury: King of Fighters had recently been released and were Daigo's first two fighting games. Street Fighter II often had a very long line with older players, so he began learning Fatal Fury first. After some time and due to the limited time he could stay at the game center, Daigo started challenging other players in Street Fighter II' (Champion Edition) for an opportunity to play even though he felt shy and had to ask for permission. This was when he discovered that he preferred competing with other players. <br>Around the time when he was a 13-year-old middle school student, Daigo shifted his main game to Vampire Hunter because he thought he was more skilled in that game than in Street Fighter II. He developed a reputation in Vampire Hunter by setting a 286-win streak recordin a single outing before he was forced to leave due to Akihabara Sega game center closing for the day. Umehara enrolled in his first tournament when he entered GAMEST Cup's national Vampire Hunter tournament in 1995, losing in the block's finals His first tournament victory came at his second tournament, GAMEST Cup's national Vampire Savior tournament in 1997, where he defeated Ōnuki (now Nuki) in the finals.<br>In 1998, at the age of 17 Daigo participated in Capcom's official Street Fighter Zero 3 national tournament and advanced to the finals which took place on a stage in Tokyo Game Show 1998: Autumn on October 11.After winning the tournament by defeating Ōnuki 3-1, Daigo, as the champion, went on to face Alex Valle, the winner of the U.S. national Street Fighter Alpha 3 tournament. The international "Grand Championship" was held in San Francisco, California on November 8. This was Daigo's first trip to the U.S. and his first overseas tournament appearance.The match was best of three games, with five-round games. Daigo came from behind to win 2-1.Both events aired as a 50-minute TV report in Japan.<br>In September 2001, Daigo's popularity led to the publishing of a mini-autobiography called VERSUS. The book's content is separated into six chapters chronicling the games in which he competes and includes background stories, anecdotes of competitions, and analysis of his opponents. <br>In 2002, Daigo appeared in a U.S. versus Japan exhibition in Japan. American players competed in four games (Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Street Fighter III 3rd Strike and Marvel vs. Capcom 2) for the right to battle Japan's best players in those respective games. Umehara only entered the 3rd Strike exhibition, but defeated all of his opponents, ending each round with Ken's fierce Shoryuken. These events were filmed for the documentary Bang the Machine.<br>In 2003, Daigo won the Super Street Fighter II Turbo tournament in the first Super Battle Opera and won the same game in Evolution Championship Series when he joined the event for the first time in the same year, making him the first player to win both the SBO and Evolution in the same year on the same game. Umehara also went to Evolution 2004 and Absolution 2004 on April 18 in England and won on SSFII Turbo there.<br>Daigo has participated regularly in a number of tournaments, appearing in at least one each year since his start in 1997, with a brief hiatus in 2008.</p>

        <span id="origen"> <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>One of the first known video game competitions took place on October 19, 1972 at Stanford University for the Spacewar game. Stanford students were invited to the Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics event whose grand prize was an annual subscription to Rolling Stone magazine, with Bruce Baugmant winning the five-player tournament, all against all as well as Tovar and Robert E. Mass winning the competition in equipment. The Space Invaders video game championship organized by Atari in 1980 was the first large-scale video game competition attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing video game competitions as a common hobby. <br> In the summer of 1980, Walter Day founded an organization, in charge of recording the highest scores, called Twin Galaxies. The organization was dedicated to helping promote video games and publishing their records through publications such as The Guinness Book of Records and in 1983 created the United States National Video Game Team. The team was involved in competitions such as the Video Game Masters tournament to enter The Guinness Book of Records. <br> During the 1970s and 1980s, video game players and tournaments began appearing on websites and magazines popular like Life and Time. One of the most recognized arcade game players is Billy Mitchell, known for holding high-scoring records in six different games including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong being recorded in the 1985 edition of The Guinness Book of Records. During this period, eSports events were broadcast on television including the Starcade program, which took place between 1982 and 1984, broadcasting a total of 133 episodes, in which the contestants would try to beat the high scores of their opponents in arcade games. A video game tournament was included as part of a television show called That's Incredible !, and the tournaments were featured for being part of the plot of several movies including TRON from 1982.</p>
